#Copy of project front page, under version control.

The goal of the RSON project is to create a file format that is easy to edit, diff, and version control, that is a superset of [http://www.json.org/ JSON] and smaller than [http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html YAML].

There is a short manual available for RSON, and an example Python 2.x decoder is available.  See the [http://code.google.com/p/rson/downloads/list downloads section].  The example decoder is about as fast as the Python 2.6 JSON decoder.  It is much faster than the pure-Python !PyYaml decoder v. 3.09, somewhat slower than the current subversion pure Python simplejson decoder, and markedly slower than simplejson or YAML C decoders.

    The example RSON decoder is quite flexible, and there is also an [http://groups.google.com/group/rson-discuss/browse_frm/thread/f1f6838dd8404917 example parser] for a superset of RSON that has XML semantics instead of JSON semantics.

To see an example of RSON in action, you can look at the default [http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/ rst2pdf] [http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/source/browse/trunk/rst2pdf/styles/styles.style default stylesheet].

Project discussion and updates happens in the rson-discuss [http://groups.google.com/group/rson-discuss google group].  Maybe at some point I will have time to add some more wiki pages and to improve the [http://code.google.com/p/rson/wiki/Manual manual] [http://rson.googlecode.com/files/rson_0_06_manual.pdf (PDF)].

The current version of RSON is 0.06, which has the following differences from 0.05:

    * Trailing commas are no longer supported.  In RSON indented syntax, they are meaningless, and in JSON syntax, they are not necessary.
    * Keys for key/value pairs are restricted to strings.  Use-cases for more complicated keys are few and far between in configuration files.
    * The manual has been changed to reflect these changes, and also to improve the examples and syntax definitions.

0.05 had the following differences from 0.04:

    * No manual changes (manual is still at 0.04)
    * Some bugs fixed that affected the ability of client code to configure the handling of object types.

0.04 had the following differences from 0.03:

    * Cosmetic changes in the manual
    * A corner case where a correct document could incorrectly throw an exception was fixed.
    * The ability of client code to configure the handling of object and array types was improved.

0.03 had the following differences from 0.02:

    * Manual enhanced with more examples and syntax description
    * Code modified so that equal sign can be used with non-string scalars

0.02 was the first version with a manual.
